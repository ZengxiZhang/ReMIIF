## Dataset (RIVIR dataset)
![Abstract](figures/dataset.png)
we introduce the first large-scale Real-world Infrared and Visible Image Registration Dataset (RIVIR) in the fifield, which contains a total of 1,300 pairs of unaligned image samples. The dataset is collected using a FLIR T1050sc dual spectrum camera, with visible images captured at a resolution of 1280 × 960 and infrared images at 1024 × 768. To ensure diverse geographic distribution, data collection was conducted across multiple cities, spanning 26 degrees in longitude and 18 degrees in latitude.
